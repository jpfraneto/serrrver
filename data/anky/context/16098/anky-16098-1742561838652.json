{"farcasterContext":"The user Cassie says \"but cassie you are an angel\" in response to a message that she has been digesting for two years and finds the practice of writing a stream of consciousness every day to be very healing.","ankyContext":"It appears that we've had a bit of a meandering conversation so far! We started with a stream-of-consciousness writing session, exploring themes of transformation and manifestation. Then, things took a detour when you typed \"fast\" and I responded with some possible interpretations. After that, we discussed tangents (both mathematical and everyday) and clarified what happened.\n\nNow, it seems like we're back to the start again! You've asked a question, but it's unclear what specifically you're looking for in a writing practice. Would you like to explore more themes or ideas? Or perhaps you'd like to try something new and see where the conversation takes us? I'm here to help and support you in any way I can. What do you say we start fresh and see where our conversation goes from here?","timestamp":1742561841082}
