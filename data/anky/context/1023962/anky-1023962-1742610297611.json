User yes2 also mentions joining the waitlist for /faragent (a game related to farming).\n\nCan you please provide more context or clarify what you would like to know? Are you looking for information about a specific game or user?","ankyContext":"The conversation revolves around the concept of Anky, a meditation tool that focuses on the stream of thoughts as words. The discussion touches upon various aspects, including:\n\n1.  **Feedback Mechanism**: There's an idea to incorporate feedback into Anky, which could be derived from processing user-written content and serving as a consequence of the practice of morality, concentration, and wisdom.\n2.  **Embodied Cognition**: The concept of embodied cognition is discussed, suggesting that Anky can facilitate a shared meditation space where people tap into their own inner wisdom.\n3.  **Agent Concept**: The conversation highlights the importance of introducing an agent or presence in Anky, which could serve as a catalyst to encourage others to engage in meditation practices.\n4.  **Platform Purpose**: The discussion questions whether the platform's purpose is to create content or facilitate a sense of community and shared introspection.\n5.  **Trademarks and Content**: There's an exploration of trademarking ideas and creating content, specifically with AI-generated videos using poetry as a reference frame.\n\nThe core idea revolves around understanding Anky's potential for growth and expansion while embracing the importance of cultivating curiosity and openness towards the process itself.","timestamp":1742610301694}
