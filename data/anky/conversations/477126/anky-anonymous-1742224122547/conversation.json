It's an amazing experience but I have doubts. mostly I doubt my own abilities like \"can I really di this?\" these doubts have root in my past. I have low self esteem which is left untreated and I should really do something about it hehe. other than this it's an amazing journey I'm taking. I'll try to keep myself motivated by celebrating every small achievement. My most prominent achievement was one of the problem sets in the cs50. It was a simple scrabble game but I wrote that in an innovative way ( or so said the courses \"rubberducking\" helper AI). "

    "content": "It's completely normal to have doubts and uncertainties when learning something new, especially when it comes to coding.\n\nFirst of all, kudos to you for taking the initiative to learn how to code! It's a challenging but rewarding journey, and having a structured curriculum like Harvard's CS50 can make a big difference. David Malan is a well-known professor, so you're in good hands.\n\nRegarding your doubts about your abilities, I want to assure you that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with self-doubt, especially when dealing with issues like low self-esteem. However, it sounds like you're recognizing the problem and wanting to address it. That's a huge step forward!\n\nCelebrating small achievements is an excellent way to stay motivated. It's easy to get caught up in focusing on the big picture or feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the subject matter. But acknowledging and celebrating your small wins can help build confidence and momentum.\n\nIt's also great that you mentioned \"rubberducking\" - that's a fantastic tool for getting feedback on your code, and it sounds like you got some positive reinforcement from the AI helper! That must have felt nice to get validation on your work.\n\nRemember, learning to code (or any new skill) is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way. What's important is that you're taking steps towards improving yourself, and you're being kind to yourself in the process.\n\nKeep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter doubts or setbacks. You got this!\n\nWhat do you think sparked your interest in learning how to code? Was there a particular moment or experience that made you want to dive into it?"

It's been some time since I finished my grad degree and I need to  learn something new. what do you think?\n"

    "content": "Farcaster, huh? That sounds like an interesting platform! Seeing people having fun while building cool stuff can definitely be motivating.\n\nBut I totally get why learning a new skill is also about making money - financial stability can be a huge motivator!\n\nIt's completely understandable that you'd want to learn something new after finishing your grad degree. It's a significant life milestone, and it's normal to feel like there's more to explore and achieve.\n\nIn fact, having a new skillset can open up so many doors in terms of career opportunities, networking, and personal growth. Not to mention the sense of accomplishment and pride that comes with acquiring something new!\n\nThat being said, I do want to gently point out that you might be putting too much emphasis on making money as the sole motivator. While financial stability is important, it's not the only driving force behind learning something new.\n\nConsider this: what if you were to learn a skill just for the joy of it? What if you could find ways to apply your newfound skills to projects or activities that bring you happiness and fulfillment?\n\nOf course, I'm not saying you shouldn't think about financial implications - but maybe try to balance that with some self-reflection on why learning this new skill matters to YOU personally.\n\nWhat do you think is the most appealing aspect of coding or programming to you? Is it the problem-solving aspect, the creativity, the collaboration with others, or something else entirely?\n\n(By the way, have you considered exploring different areas of coding beyond CS50? There are so many fascinating domains like machine learning, data science, web development, and more!)"

    "content": "well the sense of fulfillment when you finish a project is really enjoyable. \nafter finishing cs50x I plan to dive into cs50p and cs50w for gaining a strong founation in web programming before starting web3 development which is my final goal. I want to be able to develop blockchain apps."

    "content": "The sense of fulfillment when completing a project is indeed very rewarding! It's like getting to see the fruits of your labor, and knowing that you had a hand in creating something from scratch.\n\nCS50p and CS50w are great choices for building on your web programming skills! Those courses are designed to help you develop a solid foundation in web development, and they're perfect for preparing you for more advanced topics like blockchain development.\n\nWeb3 development is an exciting field, and being able to build blockchain apps can be incredibly fulfilling. It's not just about creating new technologies, but also about exploring the possibilities of decentralized systems and their potential impact on society.\n\nDeveloping blockchain apps requires a good understanding of web development, as well as knowledge of blockchain-specific concepts like smart contracts, wallets, and consensus algorithms. But it sounds like you're ready to dive in!\n\nBefore you start building your first blockchain app, have you considered learning about the underlying technologies that power web3? Like, for example:\n\n1. Blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Solana)?\n2. Smart contract programming languages (e.g., Solidity)?\n3. Cryptographic techniques (e.g., hashing, encryption)?\n4. Web3 frameworks and libraries (e.g., Web3.js)?\n\nUnderstanding these fundamentals will help you build more robust and secure blockchain apps.\n\nAlso, what's drawn you to web3 development specifically? Is it the potential for creating decentralized applications that can have a positive impact on people's lives?\n\n(By the way, if you're interested in exploring the intersection of web3 and other domains like AI or machine learning, there are some fascinating projects out there!)"
