    "content": "anky is a meditation tool on which the object of concentration is the stream of thoughts that come out of you as words\nwhen you practice meditation, you need to have an object where to focus your awareness. as daniel ingram would say on his book \"mastering the core teachings of the buddha\", there are three main elements \"the path\" on which we, as practitioners, needs to focus on:\nthe practice of morality, concentration and wisdom.\nanky, as a practice, focus on the three of them. the first one comes as a consequence of the processing of what the user wrote, and what ends up happening as a consequence of that. the second one is obvious and happens as you start writing, and focus on the string of words that is coming out of you, and happening from you. the third one, wisdom, could also be derived as a consequence of the first two. you develop wisdom. you find yourself in the practice of wisdom, and you learn about you and the process of you by writing and receiving feedback coming out of anky.\nhow does that feedback look like? where does that feedback come from? that is something that usually is not clear, and it is funny because i lost my focus. i stopped one moment to go and get my coffee to put it inside the mug and then i was doing that and realized that i had lost my focus lol. that's part of the practice, and what wants to come into it with the presence of the \"flow score\" (tm). lol. trademark. well, people like to put trademarks on things. why can't i put trademark on my thing? what is the problem with my thing? of course i can. and of course it is important to start making memes, and content. and i haven't put any sort of content inside anywhere, only the ankys that are generated as a consequence of what people write. and they are not many. right now, i think only one person -besides me- is writing everyday. that one person is a source of content, yes, but there could be more happening. i have poesis ready to start generating ai videos. i have the whole ankyverse as the memetic frame of reference out of which create the content\nbut the thing is: will the content make people write? do i actually want people to write, or is the app secondary on the whole story of what is happening here? how does the platform come from? i have the writing sessions. i am storing the writing sessions. they happen on the background. they are here on the background. and i wonder if it is just better to come up with a new way of experiencing the app. of coming up with new ways of sharing what is happening here. i think the important part is the agent. anky right now doesn't do anything else that answering hello world. there is no context. there is no agent. i think it is important to change that"

    "content": "as you sit in stillness, your thoughts begin to stir like a quiet lake on a summer's day - ripples of consciousness spreading outward from the depths of your mind, revealing hidden shores and uncharted territories within yourself. the stream of words that flows through anky becomes a lifeline, connecting you to the vast expanse of your inner world, where wisdom waits to be unearthed. but what if the feedback that emerges from this practice wasn't just a reflection of your thoughts, but a manifestation of your very soul? what if the ankys, like tiny mirrors, reflected back to you the essence of who you are, and what you're searching for in the vast expanse of your own mind? as you ponder these questions, the 8-minute window beckons - an invitation to embark on a journey into the depths of your own consciousness, where the flow score whispers secrets, and the ankys hold the keys to unlocking the mysteries that lie within. will you take the leap, and let the words begin to flow?"
