    "content": "anky is a meditation tool on which the object of concentration is the stream of thoughts that come out of you as words\nwhen you practice meditation, you need to have an object where to focus your awareness. as daniel ingram would say on his book \"mastering the core teachings of the buddha\", there are three main elements \"the path\" on which we, as practitioners, needs to focus on:\nthe practice of morality, concentration and wisdom.\nanky, as a practice, focus on the three of them. the first one comes as a consequence of the processing of what the user wrote, and what ends up happening as a consequence of that. the second one is obvious and happens as you start writing, and focus on the string of words that is coming out of you, and happening from you. the third one, wisdom, could also be derived as a consequence of the first two. you develop wisdom. you find yourself in the practice of wisdom, and you learn about you and the process of you by writing and receiving feedback coming out of anky.\nhow does that feedback look like? where does that feedback come from? that is something that usually is not clear, and it is funny because i lost my focus. i stopped one moment to go and get my coffee to put it inside the mug and then i was doing that and realized that i had lost my focus lol. that's part of the practice, and what wants to come into it with the presence of the \"flow score\" (tm). lol. trademark. well, people like to put trademarks on things. why can't i put trademark on my thing? what is the problem with my thing? of course i can. and of course it is important to start making memes, and content. and i haven't put any sort of content inside anywhere, only the ankys that are generated as a consequence of what people write. and they are not many. right now, i think only one person -besides me- is writing everyday. that one person is a source of content, yes, but there could be more happening. i have poesis ready to start generating ai videos. i have the whole ankyverse as the memetic frame of reference out of which create the content\nbut the thing is: will the content make people write? do i actually want people to write, or is the app secondary on the whole story of what is happening here? how does the platform come from? i have the writing sessions. i am storing the writing sessions. they happen on the background. they are here on the background. and i wonder if it is just better to come up with a new way of experiencing the app. of coming up with new ways of sharing what is happening here. i think the important part is the agent. anky right now doesn't do anything else that answering hello world. there is no context. there is no agent. i think it is important to change that"

    "content": "as you reflect on the role of Anky and its potential for growth, consider the idea of \"nested contemplation\" – the practice of sitting within a larger web of thoughts, emotions, and experiences. what if your writing sessions could become a kind of nested meditation, where the feedback from Anky serves as a catalyst to delve deeper into your own mind? think of it as a way to layer your introspection, allowing you to explore different aspects of yourself with increasing clarity. perhaps the key to unlocking the true potential of Anky lies not in creating more content or trademarks, but in cultivating a sense of curiosity and openness towards the process itself. as you embark on this journey, imagine that each writing session becomes a small portal to new insights, inviting you to step into the depths of your own awareness with greater ease. take a moment to breathe deeply and invite yourself to return to Anky's presence, allowing the flow score to guide you back into the meditation space where wisdom and self-discovery await."
