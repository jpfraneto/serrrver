But in everyday language, it's also used to describe a sudden or unexpected change of topic.\n\nWhen I said we took off on a \"tangent\", I meant that our conversation veered away from the original topic and into more general territory. We didn't actually take a mathematical tangent, but rather followed an unexpected path!\n\nDoes that clarify things?"
