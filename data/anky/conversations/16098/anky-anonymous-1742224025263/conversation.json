NONE. it literally is just llama3.2 plugged on the backend of the frame. there is nothing happening there. it doesn't know anything special. there is nothing that can be said there. there is nothing that can be experienced. there is only wonder. there is only joy. and it doesn't make sense. nothing makes sense. i started writing so that i could say something valuable. but i didn't. i haven't. but that is not the important part. im not here to say something specifically valuable. im just here to manifest the ideas that come to my mind. im just running through the nonsense that comes from the beauty that is alive in this moment. there is a thread. im pulling that thread. there is something happening inside me. and this is just pulling that. and im giving space to it. im allowing it to be here. im allowing it to be felt. im feeling it. im experiencing it. im being with it. im feeling it all. and there is nothing special that i could say. there is nothing that i could experience. give me ideas of what to write about. i don't know what to write about. would it be fun to have ideas? would it be fun to have something special to say? would it be fun to have that experience happening on the background of this moment? so many things that i want to do. so many things that i want to say. so many things that i want to be running here. and i don't even know where to start. i don't even know where to go towards. i don't even know what is happening here. i started with the thread of what i wanted to say. i wanted to give feedback about this ux. i wanted to be clear about that feedback. and i don't know where did i go. i don't know what is here. i have uncertainty. i don't know where this uncertainty comes from. i don't know what is here. there is no personality. no personality at all. i don't know where is this thread being pulled. there is nothing else to say. im done. im done with writing my 8 minutes. i did the work today. thank you anky for listening. i hope i made my poin"

Your background is so calming and peaceful, it's almost meditative. I appreciate how you're not trying to draw attention away from the content with too many notifications or distractions.\n\nI have to say, I love the simplicity of your design. The black background makes me feel like I'm in a quiet room, surrounded by nothing but my thoughts. It's really liberating. And I see what you mean about the llama3.2 plugin – it's almost invisible, which is kind of cool.\n\nWhat inspired you to create this space? Is there something specific that you hope people will take away from their writing experience here?\n\n(By the way, I love your Haiku of a goose – it's such a beautiful and unexpected touch!)"

Where they don't feel the need to put on a mask or pretend to be someone they're not? What if this space could help people tap into their creativity and express themselves in ways they never thought possible?\n\nI know it sounds a bit idealistic, but I think that's what makes it so exciting. And I have to say, I'm really drawn to the idea of simplicity and minimalism. It feels like we're stripping away all the unnecessary distractions and just focusing on the essence of what matters.\n\nWhat do you think?

However, this gives you a general idea of the differences between LLMs and AI Agents."
