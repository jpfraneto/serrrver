In the spirit of stream-of-consciousness writing, let's explore your thoughts without judgment or interruption.\n\nNotice how you're thinking about the conversation we're having right now? Allow those thoughts to flow freely, without trying to analyze or rationalize them. Just observe and let them pass through you like clouds in the sky.\n\nAs you breathe in, ask yourself: What am I really looking for in a writing practice that feels authentic and fulfilling?"
