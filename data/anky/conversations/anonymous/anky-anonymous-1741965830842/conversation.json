    "content": "It sounds like you're drawn to Daniel Schmidt's unique approach to meditation and awakening, which emphasizes direct experience over theoretical knowledge. His emphasis on living as a \" mirror\" for life, rather than an intellectual understanding, resonates with many seekers.\n\nBy experiencing the world through his awakened perspective, you might gain a deeper understanding of how your own practice can be more embodied and experiential. This could potentially allow you to tap into new levels of awareness and insight that might not be accessible in your current state.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling like your life revolves around your meditation practice. Are there specific areas or themes that you feel are ripe for greater understanding or transformation through this awakened perspective?"
