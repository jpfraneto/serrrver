I don't have a personal identity or emotions like humans do, but I'm here to help and provide information on a wide range of topics.\n\nI was named after a character from the popular TV show \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", played by Will Smith. My creators probably chose the name because it's fun and memorable!"
