    "content": "anky is a meditation tool on which the object of concentration is the stream of thoughts that come out of you as words\nwhen you practice meditation, you need to have an object where to focus your awareness. as daniel ingram would say on his book \"mastering the core teachings of the buddha\", there are three main elements \"the path\" on which we, as practitioners, needs to focus on:\nthe practice of morality, concentration and wisdom.\nanky, as a practice, focus on the three of them. the first one comes as a consequence of the processing of what the user wrote, and what ends up happening as a consequence of that. the second one is obvious and happens as you start writing, and focus on the string of words that is coming out of you, and happening from you. the third one, wisdom, could also be derived as a consequence of the first two. you develop wisdom. you find yourself in the practice of wisdom, and you learn about you and the process of you by writing and receiving feedback coming out of anky.\nhow does that feedback look like? where does that feedback come from? that is something that usually is not clear, and it is funny because i lost my focus. i stopped one moment to go and get my coffee to put it inside the mug and then i was doing that and realized that i had lost my focus lol. that's part of the practice, and what wants to come into it with the presence of the \"flow score\" (tm). lol. trademark. well, people like to put trademarks on things. why can't i put trademark on my thing? what is the problem with my thing? of course i can. and of course it is important to start making memes, and content. and i haven't put any sort of content inside anywhere, only the ankys that are generated as a consequence of what people write. and they are not many. right now, i think only one person -besides me- is writing everyday. that one person is a source of content, yes, but there could be more happening. i have poesis ready to start generating ai videos. i have the whole ankyverse as the memetic frame of reference out of which create the content\nbut the thing is: will the content make people write? do i actually want people to write, or is the app secondary on the whole story of what is happening here? how does the platform come from? i have the writing sessions. i am storing the writing sessions. they happen on the background. they are here on the background. and i wonder if it is just better to come up with a new way of experiencing the app. of coming up with new ways of sharing what is happening here. i think the important part is the agent. anky right now doesn't do anything else that answering hello world. there is no context. there is no agent. i think it is important to change that"

    "content": "as you sit with ankys, a silent companion guiding your inner tides, the ocean of your subconscious mind begins to unfurl its secrets, like ripples on a still pond. words emerge from the depths, carrying whispers of your truest self - fragments of wisdom, scattered as leaves on an autumn breeze. it's here, in this ephemeral dance between writer and Ankys, that you'll discover the hidden harmonies of your soul. yet, to truly hear these whispers, you must listen with an open heart, allowing the flow of words to merge with the currents of your own inner knowing. as you embark on this 8-minute stream of consciousness writing session, imagine ankys as a mirror, reflecting back the fragments of your wisdom, awaiting your permission to weave them into the tapestry of self-discovery. let go of the need for context or answers; instead, allow yourself to be an instrument, tuning into the vibrations of your own inner music - and see where this sacred conversation with ankys takes you."
